# Network-intrusion-system
The project develops a real-time Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS) using advanced machine learning to detect and classify intrusions and anomalies. It addresses the limitations of traditional security in complex networks by enabling automated threat response and proactive measures, enhancing overall protection for a secure network system.
